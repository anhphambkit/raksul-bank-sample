# Acceptance evidence

This document maps the product requirements to the implementation and verification evidence. PASS means implemented and verified within the documented demo scope; it does not imply a production banking backend.

## Transfer enhancements

- Account numbers are resolved within their bank: an external number matching a local account stays external and never credits that local account.
- Saved recipients are selectable with search by name, bank or last four digits. Keyboard selection, draft reload and returning from Review are covered at 1440px and 390px.
- New recipients are saved only when the current form's **Save recipient for next time** option is selected and the transfer commits. One-time transfers retain the receipt snapshot without adding a contact. The explicit save choice is part of idempotency; legacy requests remain replayable.
- Same-bank lookup is independent of saved contacts. The prefilled Jordan Lee account is verified through the demo directory, then becomes a saved recipient only after an opted-in successful transfer.
- An idempotency conflict offers **Check transaction activity**, refreshes banking queries and permits navigation. It retains its terminal status on reload and never retries or replaces the request key automatically.
- Verification: 266 unit/component tests, 20 Chromium E2E tests, 5 Storybook checks, lint, formatting, typecheck, production build, SSR smoke, Storybook build and the local link checker passed.

## Final checklist — 2026-09-07

The implementation uses 100 seed transactions and saved/new recipients; an internal recipient models another person's account and receives the matching credit.

### Core — product and data

- [x] Accounts: all three owned accounts show identity/type, masked number, USD balance and active/frozen usability; hidden recipient accounts stay outside the customer projection.
- [x] Activity: 100 deterministic transactions across six months, varied amounts, counterparties, debit/credit directions and statuses.
- [x] Locate activity: text/account/direction/type/status/date filters, Apply/Clear, no-results recovery, pagination and URL restoration without mutating source data.
- [x] Own transfer: select source/destination, amount and reference; validate, review, confirm and receive a committed receipt.
- [x] Another-person transfer: saved internal recipient gets a hidden credit and linked activity; saved external recipient produces a source debit and recipient snapshot, with external settlement outside the mock.
- [x] Validation: missing or unowned source, unavailable recipient, frozen accounts, same account, nonpositive/fractional/unsafe amount, insufficient funds, incompatible currency and destination overflow are rejected.
- [x] Consistency: debit/credit/activity/receipt commit together; failed validation or an aborted write leaves the previous snapshot intact.
- [x] Feedback: pending/disabled confirmation, validation messages, definite rejection, success and uncertain technical outcome with explicit same-key retry.
- [x] UI consistency: successful transfer cancels stale requests and invalidates banking queries; balances/activity persist across navigation, reload and reset.
- [x] Data boundary: typed API → MSW → use cases/domain → repository; no component-owned banking fixtures or direct balance/storage mutations.
- [x] Model: ownership, account/transaction/transfer relationships, recipient snapshots and statuses are explicit; money uses safe integer cents.

### Required deliverables

- [x] Working local application, pinned runtime/lockfile and install/run/build instructions; seed and mock mechanism are versioned.
- [x] README explains what was built, deliberate omissions, model/relationships, assumptions, transfer semantics and persistence limits.
- [x] Exactly three ADRs, each with Context, Alternatives, Decision and Consequences, consistent with the implementation.

### Senior quality checks

- [x] Feature/domain/data separation, strict typed contracts, structured errors and lint-enforced dependency direction.
- [x] Loading/error/retry/empty states, currency/date formatting, explicit status labels and basic keyboard/form accessibility.
- [x] Responsive browser checks at 1440/768/390px, including masking, overflow, transfer review and detail-drawer focus.
- [x] Duplicate confirmation/replay cannot double-debit; competing writes check current funds; rollback is covered.
- [x] Nuxt demo shell waits for browser storage readiness; backend SSR uses request-local queries, error serialization and cache hydration without duplicate accounts fetching in the tested flow.
- [x] No console debug logs, TODO/FIXME markers or explicit `any` types in runtime/test source; automated lint and browser checks pass.

### Nice-to-Have — completed

- [x] Review new recipients without a write; confirmation atomically saves the recipient and transfer with validation and deduplication.
- [x] Save and restore draft/review/immutable retry key after close/reload, with explicit same-key replay and storage-failure protection.
- [x] Same-origin demo tabs refresh automatically after committed changes/reset; reset clears recovery context.
- [x] Persistent light/dark mode with responsive theme styling and hydration-safe toggle.
- [x] Storybook catalog: 11 component states, checked in both light/dark themes.
- [x] Visual regression: 12 reviewed macOS Chromium baselines across light/dark and desktop/mobile.

- [x] High-value domain/service tests: own/internal/external balances and activity, invalid requests, rollback, idempotency and concurrent spending.
- [x] Transaction filtering/API/component tests and a native-browser transfer → receipt → balance/activity → reload/reset scenario.
- [x] Individual transaction drawer, including keyboard focus and preserved filter/page state.
- [x] Production architecture proposal covering client, Banking API, identity, database and communication flow; infrastructure remains proposal-only.

### Scope boundaries

- Authentication and spending insights are not included.
- Browser coverage uses Chromium with responsive viewports.
- Cross-device synchronization requires a shared backend and is not included.
- Production backend capabilities such as authentication, FX, fees, settlement and payment processing are outside the demo scope.

No outstanding Core or required-deliverable defect was identified. The scope boundaries above are documented demo limitations, not unfinished required functionality.

| Transactions: locate a transaction with filters        | PASS   | `transactionQuerySchema.ts`, `listTransactions.ts`, `useTransactionRoute.ts`, `TransactionFilters.vue`; HTTP/UI tests cover combined filters, UTC dates, pagination, invalid links, empty results and Back/Forward.                                                                           | None within demo scope.                                                                                   |
| Transfers: move money between own accounts             | PASS   | `src/use-cases/transfers/executeTransfer.ts` debits/credits both accounts and creates two linked entries; `executeTransfer.test.ts` and `scripts/e2e/demo.spec.mjs` verify exact persisted cents.                                                                                             | None within demo scope.                                                                                   |

| Transfers: correct balances and resulting activity     | PASS   | `executeTransfer.test.ts` verifies full snapshots, linked debit/credit entries, external source-only debit, conflict/replay, competing spends, overflow rejection and aborted writes.                                                                                                         | None within demo scope.                                                                                   |
| Transfers: clear outcome feedback                      | PASS   | Details → Review → Complete in `src/pages/transfer.vue`; `TransferReceipt.vue` displays receipt identity/time. `transferFailure.ts` distinguishes definite rejection from uncertain responses; `transferFlow.test.ts` covers explicit retry with the same key.                                | Recovery survives close/reload in browser storage; storage clearing/eviction remains a limitation.        |
| Data: deliberate mock boundary and banking model       | PASS   | Domain entities in `src/domain`, public contracts in `src/contracts`, use cases and repository port, thin MSW handlers, validated IndexedDB adapter.

| Data: included realistic seed                          | PASS   | `src/data/seed/createSeedState.ts`: one fictional customer, three owned accounts, three hidden recipients, six saved beneficiaries, a separate unsaved same-bank directory account, varied activity and six completed seed transfers. Repository tests check deterministic balances/activity. | None within demo scope.                                                                                   |
| Data: consistency after transfer                       | PASS   | Atomic read/validate/write repository transactions; rollback/concurrent-connection tests in `src/tests/data`; browser transfer/reload/reset checks use native IndexedDB.                                                                                                                      | Browser retention and cross-device state remain outside the demo; same-origin tab refresh is implemented. |
